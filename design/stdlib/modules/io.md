## io

### debug
`( value label -- value )` — Write the string label, `": "`, and the value's
pretty-printed representation plus newline, leaving the value on the stack.
Semantically `io.prin ": " io.prin io.inspect`; a non-string label is the
same `'type` failure as `io.prin`.

### eprint
`( string -- )` — Write a string followed by a newline to the Session's
diagnostics stream: standard error under the command line, the host's
diagnostics writer when embedded, and never standard output. When the host
supplies no diagnostics writer the string is dropped and the word succeeds.
Non-string is `'type`; a failed write is `'io`.

### inspect
`( value -- value )` — Pretty-print a value while leaving it on the stack;
the pipeline probe. Semantically `dup io.pp`.

### pp
`( value -- )` — Pretty-print any value plus newline in the display layout of
Printing. Best-effort: huge leaves may be elided, so there is no round-trip
guarantee. Use core `str` for canonical rendering.

### prin
`( string -- )` — Write a string's characters as UTF-8 without adding a
newline. Non-string is `'type`.

### print
`( string -- )` — Write a string followed by a newline. Semantically
`io.prin "\n" io.prin`.

### stack
Stack-polymorphic; leaves the operand stack unchanged. Print each value in the
currently visible operand window as a bottom-up indexed display block. `[0]`
is the bottom and the largest index is the top; continuation lines align after
the prefix. An isolated quotation sees only values above its isolation floor.
An empty visible window writes nothing. Rendering is best-effort and may use
the same multiline dictionary, array, and elision layout as `io.pp`.

### stdin
`( -- string )` — Read the whole standard input stream once. Legal where stdin
carries data (`-e` and script-file modes); `'io` where stdin is the program
source or when it has already been read.
